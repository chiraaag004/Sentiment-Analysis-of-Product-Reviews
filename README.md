# Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews

This project applies NLP techniques using both rule-based and transformer-based models to classify product review sentiments. Built in a Jupyter notebook, it demonstrates the application of `NLTK`, `Transformers`, and logistic regression for sentiment scoring and visualization.

## ðŸš€ Objective
To analyze and classify customer product reviews as positive or negative using both traditional NLP and pretrained transformer models.

## ðŸ§  Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- NLTK (SentimentIntensityAnalyzer)
- Hugging Face Transformers
- tqdm

## ðŸ“‚ Contents
- Data reading and preprocessing
- Sentiment analysis using VADER (NLTK)
